      "answer": "You can type virtually anything!

The AI works best with clear, descriptive prompts that specify what you want to see in your coloring page."
    },
    "2": {
      "question": "Can I use the images I create for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Yes! All coloring pages you generate are yours to use however you'd like, including for commercial purposes. You can print them, share them, sell them, or use them in your business without any restrictions or royalty fees."
    },
    "3": {
      "question": "Can I download and print the coloring pages?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Every coloring page can be downloaded in high-quality PNG or PDF format. They're optimized for standard 8.5x11 inch paper and print beautifully on any home printer. The clean, black line art uses minimal ink while providing crisp details."
    },
    "4": {
      "question": "What is the quality of the generated images?",
      "answer": "Our AI generates high-resolution coloring pages with clean, professional line art. Each image is optimized for printing with clear outlines, appropriate detail levels, and smooth curves that are perfect for coloring with crayons, markers, or colored pencils."
    },
    "5": {
      "question": "Is this tool safe for my kids to use?",
      "answer": "Yes! Our tool is completely child-safe. We have built-in content filters that prevent inappropriate content from being generated. The interface is simple and intuitive, making it easy for kids to use independently while parents can feel confident about the safety of the content."
    },
    "6": {
      "question": "What happens if someone types an inappropriate prompt?",
      "answer": "Our advanced content filtering system automatically detects and blocks inappropriate prompts. If an unsuitable prompt is entered, the system will politely ask the user to try a different, family-friendly description instead. This keeps the platform safe for users of all ages."
    },
    "7": {
      "question": "Can I use the generator on my mobile phone or tablet?",
      "answer": "Yes! Our generator is fully responsive and works perfectly on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. The interface adapts to your screen size, making it easy to create and download coloring pages from any device with an internet connection."
    },
    "8": {
      "question": "Do you save my prompts or the images I create?",
      "answer": "Your privacy is important to us. While we may temporarily store images for technical purposes, we don't permanently save your personal creations or prompts unless you specifically choose to share them publicly. You have full control over your content and privacy settings."
    },
    "9": {
      "question": "What languages does the generator support?",
      "answer": "Currently, our generator works best with English prompts, but it can understand and process descriptions in multiple languages including Spanish, French, German, and others. For the best results, we recommend using clear, simple language regardless of which language you choose."
